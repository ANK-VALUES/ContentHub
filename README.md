## what's content hub

Content hub is a collection of files and issues related to ANK_VALUES videos channels.

> what's ANK_VALUES?

With the massive growth of information and knowledge, human need to find a right way to cheek the credibility of the propositions easily and accelerate the speed to know(not master) knowledge in different areas.

I know there are already some commercial platforms warppering themselves as "knowledge market" or "QA community", but I think that is still to far from the targets I mentioned above. Commercial platforms do make fantastic videos or books than community, but, how can them face the so many different areas nowadays. How can them maintain each topic (such as 'methods to build a CNN model on your PC.' and 'Singapore gay legalization' etc...) all the time. 

Thanks to Linus Torvalds, we have git now. We can easily control and maintain each topics in a communitative way.

The following propositions drive me create ANK_VALUES:
*   community can provide more topics.
*   providers in this platform can provide high-quality topics.
*   topics can be maintained easily with git.

However, it may be a mess if we simply push various kind of 
propositions in this repository. That is why i make some classification and definition on topics.

There are three main functions of human language.

*   command -> CMD
*   statement -> STM
*   express emotion -> ESE

Topic is a data structure as followed
```json
{
    "name":"How to implement a suburban home defense system at low cost",
    "id":"8aaa07afad614586aefae434bd98489b",//The  md5 of the name
    "type":"STM",//this topic is a statement(STM) which equals to "we can do following things to build a defense system ... at low cost".
    "credibility":0.50,//if the topic is a STM, you need to add a credibility attribute on it. the range of it is [0,1]. Zero means the STM is totally a shit, otherwise it is a truth.
    "innerRefers":[
        "dbe75952a4d4aa910db41d7bb10f9507",
        "a52504527ecb5467e9378d3f8ac7052c",
    ],//if you refers some topic in ANK_VALUES, just add their ids to this list.
    "outerRefers":[
        {
            "GB/T7714":[
            "Yang G X , Li F J . Investigation of Security and Defense System for Home Based on Internet of Things[C]// 2010 International Conference on Web Information Systems and Mining (WISM 2010). IEEE Computer Society, 2010."
            ]//use format name as attribute and append content in the list.
            ,
            "webPage":[
                "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermographic_camera"
            ]//it is totally ok to add web pages to this list as well.

        }
    ]
    "initialAuthor":"Kevin",
    "tags":["technology","computer vision",...],//you can add these tags to help people overview your topic
    
    //I know what you want to say - "how to find the tag system where i can choose tags from ?". I must say sorry. currently i still have not built that, but it will come soon, man.


    "for":["age12-22","primary"],//selector to your target population
    "notFor":["age0-12","senior"],//filter
    "warning":["possible hurt level-middle","bad language level-low"]//some warnings of content

}
```


ANK_VALUES wants to create a *communitative, trustworthy, maintainable* content channel to push cognition forward.


##  why create it


If you want to find more data about each video or correct some errors by request a merge ,this is the right place for you.

With the great design of git ,you can easily create your own branch to show your talent or update to get the latest topics.

What's more , open source drives us to create topics  more seriously.
